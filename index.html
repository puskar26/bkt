          Bhaktapur Durbar Square (Nepal Bhasa: 𑐏𑑂𑐰𑐥 𑐮𑐵𑐫𑐎𑐸‎ Nepali: भक्तपुर
          दरबार क्षेत्र) is a former royal palace complex located in Bhaktapur,
          Nepal. It housed the Malla kings of Nepal from 14th to 15th century
          and the kings of the Kingdom of Bhaktapur from 15th to late 18th
          century until the kingdom was conquered in 1769. Today, this square is
          recognised by UNESCO, managed jointly by the Archeological Department
          of Nepal and Bhaktapur Municipality, and is undergoing extensive
          restoration due to the damages from the earthquake in 1934 and the
          recent earthquake of 2015.

        <p class="description">
          The Durbar Square is a generic name for the Malla palace square and
          can be found in Kathmandu and Patan as well. The one in Bhaktapur was
          considered the biggest and the grandest among the three during its
          independency but now many of the buildings that once occupied the
          square has been lost to the frequent earthquakes. During its height,
          Bhaktapur Durbar Square contained 99 courtyards but today hardly 15 of
          these courtyards remain. The square has lost most of its buildings and
          courtyards to frequent earthquakes, particularly those in 1833 and
          1934 and only a few of the damaged buildings were restored.

        <p id="second" class="title">Etymology</p>
        <p class="description">
          The term Lāyakū (Nepal Bhasa: 𑐮𑐵𑐫𑐎𑐸‎) is used to refer to any of the
          Malla dynasty palace or palace square.In order to differentiate it
          from the palace square of other cities, the name khwopa (Nepal Bhasa:
          𑐏𑑂𑐰𑐥‎), the Newar name of Bhaktapur is prefixed. The term Lyākū
          originates from the Sanskrit word rājakula, meaning "royal palace".
          Today, the term Bhaktapur Durbar Square and its Nepali translation is
          also widely used.

          The Durbar Square of Bhaktapur once fortified and occupied a very
          large area.After, Bhaktapur was defeated by the Gorkhali forces, the
          palace square fell into disrepair and the earthquakes of 1833 and 1934
          reduced the square to its present size.The former palace ground have
          been used as government offices, schools and private houses. Like the
          ones of Kathmandu and Patan, Bhaktapur Durbar Square contains various
          temples, palaces and courtyards all of which were built in the
          traditional Nepalese architecture.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          In general, the Durbar Square is divided into three parts based on its
          location: Kvathū Lyākū, literally meaning 'lower part of the royal
          palace' in Nepal Bhasa, the Kvathū Lyākū is the westermost part of the
          palace and is bounded by the Khaumā district in the west and the Vyāsi
          district in the north.This part contains the Lyākū Dhvākhā gate, the
          ruins of Basantapūra and Chaukota palace and a replica of the Char
          Dham of India.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          Dathū Lyākū, literally means 'middle palace' and contains the
          principal buildings and temples of the square. This part contains the
          two main royal palaces, the Luṁ dhvākā (or the Golden gate) which
          servers as the main entrance to the inner courtyards of the palace and
          a few temples.The final part of the palace square is Thanthū Lyākū,
          literally meaning 'upper palace', it is the least preserved of the
          three parts as the former palaces and temples after being destroyed by
          an earthquake in 1833 has been replaced with government offices,
          schools and even residential buildings.

        <p class="title">Impact of Earthquakes</p>
        <p class="description">
          The Durbar Square was severely damaged by the earthquake in 1934 and
          hence appears more spacious than the others, in Kathmandu and Patan.
          Originally, there were 99 courtyards attached to this place, but now
          only 6 remain. Before the 1934 earthquake, there were 3 separate
          groups of temples. Currently, the square is surrounded by buildings
          that survived the quake. On 25 April 2015, another major earthquake
          damaged many buildings in the square. The main temple in Bhaktapur's
          square lost its roof, while the Vatsala Devi temple, known for its
          sandstone walls and gold-topped pagodas, was also demolished. In
          total, 116 historical and cultural monuments were damaged.
